        <h3>Project Management</h3>
        <p>I started managing projects as soon as I graduated college. My first try was riddled with bumps and barriers, but we reached 100% output delivery nonetheless. Now, I manage software development projects while learning the ins and outs of
          web development.</p>

        <h3>Development Work</h3>
        <p>A different kind of development. While shifting my career path towards building software systems is my current goal, development work remains a long-term career outlook. Eventually, I would like to explore how I could coalesce these fields
          of expertise and help ignite further changes for the better.</p>
